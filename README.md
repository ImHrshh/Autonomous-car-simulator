# Autonomous-car-simulator
The self-driving-car-simulator repository is a project that aims to simulate the behavior of a self-driving car within a web browser environment. This project is implemented using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, providing a visually immersive experience.

The simulator includes a virtual environment where users can observe the car's autonomous navigation and interact with various aspects of the simulation. The project utilizes JavaScript to handle the car's control logic, simulate sensor data, and perform decision-making algorithms.

HTML and CSS are employed to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for the simulator. The HTML structure defines the layout and structure of the web page, while CSS is responsible for styling and visual enhancements, ensuring an engaging and visually appealing experience.

Users can experiment with different scenarios, modify the car's behavior, and observe the impact of changes in real-time. The repository also includes documentation, code examples, and resources to help users understand and extend the project.

By utilizing the self-driving-car-simulator repository, developers and enthusiasts can explore the fundamentals of autonomous driving, experiment with algorithms, and gain hands-on experience in a virtual environment.
